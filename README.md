Game of Life in Java
===============
This source code intends to implement the [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life "Game of Life") in Java language. Programming in TDD, the unit test framework is JUnit.

This is my first time programming in Java, welcome to refactor my source code and give more comments.
